# NotesApp
A simple notes app written entirely with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. All processing is handled clientside by the JavaScript. Your notes are stored as cookies, which last as long as your browser will allow them to (up to 100 years if your browser allows it). Suitable to run on virtually any HTTP server capable of serving static pages. This app is lightweight, not using JQuery or any other heavy JavaScript libraries/frameworks.

Currently only tested on Mozilla Firefox 147.0.3, Debian 13.
