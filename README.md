A simple notes web application written entirely with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. All processing is handled clientside by the JavaScript. Your notes are stored in your web browser's local storage. This is a fairly secure, private place to store data within your web browser where it won't be sent to the webserver. Suitable to run on virtually any HTTP server capable of serving static pages. This app is lightweight, not using JQuery or any other heavy JavaScript libraries/frameworks.

Limitations are your notes will only be available in the same web browser you used to create them. Also, there will be a maximum localStorage size imposed by whichever web browser you use (though this is typically configurable).

Currently only tested on Mozilla Firefox 147.0.3, Debian 13.
